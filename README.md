# ROBLOX STUDIO ICONS

An extension created to add the roblox studio icons to your VS Code, Cursor and any other IDE compatible with it.

I know there is already one working for VS Code but since Microsoft doesn't allow to use VS Code extensions in Cursor anymore, I wasn't able to use it anymore.
So, I decided to create it.

## ICONS
- Roblox Services (Server Script Server, Replicated Storage...)
- Some file extensions (toml, json, git, png...)

## COMPATIBILITY
- Visual Studio Code
- Cursor
- Rojo (image for src)
- Azul (image for sync)

## LICENSE
MIT

Will continue to update it if roblox changes any icon or if I get any request to add something different or new.
