# ROBLOX STUDIO ICONS

An extension created to add the roblox studio icons to your VS Code, Cursor and any other IDE compatible with it.

I know there is already one working for VS Code but since Microsoft doesn't allow to use VS Code extensions in Cursor anymore, I wasn't able to use it anymore.
So, I decided to create it.


## ICONS
- Features 2 different icon themes
- Roblox Services (ServerScriptService, ReplicatedStorage...)
- Some file extensions (toml, json, git, png...)


## COMPATIBILITY
- Visual Studio Code
- Cursor
- Rojo
- Azul
- Argon


## LICENSE
MIT


Will continue to update it if roblox changes any icon or if I get any request to add something different or new.
