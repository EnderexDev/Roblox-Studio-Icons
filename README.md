An extension created to add the roblox studio icons to your VS Code, Cursor and any other IDE compatible with it.

I know there is already one working for VS Code but since Microsoft doesn't allow to use VS Code extensions in Cursor anymore, I wasn't able to use it anymore. So, I decided to create it.

It has almost everything you need for your icons. Roblox Services like Server Scripte Service, Replicated Storage, Workspace etc... It also includes some icons for some file extensions like toml (in case you use selene), json, git etc...

Will continue to update it if roblox changes any icon or if I get any request to add something different or new.
